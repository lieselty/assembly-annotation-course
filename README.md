# Assembly and Annotation of A. thaliana
## Assembly
Scripts from 01 to 03 compute some statistics about the reads, 02 also trimm the reads for the transcriptome. Scripts 04 to 07 corresponds to the different assemblies, with different assemblers (flye, hifiasm, LJA for the genome assembly and trinity for the transcriptome assembly). Scripts 08 to 11 perfom evaluation of the assemblies and 12 compares the different assemblies between them. 
## Annotation
Script 13 perfomrs the annotation of TEs using EDTA (13_1, 13_2, and 13_3 analyse the results). Script 14 perfomrs the gene annotation. Scripts 20 to 29 are used to assess the quality of the annotation
